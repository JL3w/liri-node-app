LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

You can use 4 different commands:
  * `concert-this` "Your favorite band here"
    Displays
    * Name of the venue

    * Venue location

    * Date of the Event 

   * `spotify-this-song` "Your favorite song here"
    Displays
     * Artist(s)

     * The song's name

     * A preview link of the song from Spotify

     * The album that the song is from

   * `movie-this` "your favorite movie here"
    Displays
       * Title of the movie.
       * Year the movie came out.
       * IMDB Rating of the movie.
       * Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.
       * Country where the movie was produced.
       * Language of the movie.
       * Plot of the movie.
       * Actors in the movie.
   * `do-what-it-says` 
       * Reads a file for a static command and media file and performs the command on that media

* As my first CLI app, refactoring LIRI to be more modular was a challenge. Of great help was simply reading and fully understanding how existing apps acheived this.
